"""Application entrypoint.

Generated from the approved architecture: one router per component that owns
endpoints, one route per endpoint the API spec declares. Every generated route
is a stub that returns a typed placeholder, so the service starts, serves its
OpenAPI document and passes its tests before a single handler is implemented.
